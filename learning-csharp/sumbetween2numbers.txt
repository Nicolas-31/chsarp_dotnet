/*

CalculateSumOfNumbersBetween
Using the while loop, implement the CalculateSumOfNumbersBetween method, which given two integers called firstNumber and lastNumber, should calculate the sum of numbers between them (including the numbers themselves).



If lastNumber is smaller than firstNumber, the result shall be 0.

For example:

for firstNumber equal to 5 and lastNumber equal to 10, the result should be 45 because this is the sum of numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

for firstNumber equal to -5 and lastNumber equal to 5, the result should be 0 because this is the sum of numbers -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

for firstNumber equal to 10 and lastNumber also equal to 10, the result should be 10 because, to the sum, we include the only number, which is 10

for firstNumber equal to 5 and lastNumber equal to 4, the result should be 0 because the lastNumber is smaller than firstNumber
